# Simple-Genetic-Algorithm
A simple genetic algorithm to generate a string of ‘1’s of length 20.

Performs 50 runs, and finds the average generation number at which the GA
converges.

Prints out, on each generation cycle, the fitness of the best
individual in the current population and the average fitness of the population as a
whole.
